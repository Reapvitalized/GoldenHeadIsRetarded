1. You'd have to handhold them for them to give credits of your script.
2. They'll never try to find the owner of the script, You have to do it for them.
3. They have once stolen credit from wisp (The recent leaked script) and credited themselves instead of wisp in their release 
4. They didn't credit the person who actually cracked the script (neko), Because that's just too hard.
5. Golden has shown time and time again that they intentionally don't credit some creators to get attention to themselves 
6. They try their best to play safe with their words but they've finally slipped up this time.
-# To clarify, Golden has always been very careful on their actions and words, But the actions they did when this message was sent was just wrong.
7. Regarding recent drama, Golden wanted a reason to leak the jinwoo moveset (Refer to the image below.)
8. This isn't just scripting drama, They're still putting their members in terrible environments, Because most of their members are children
9. In their server, They have a "n word pass" role, I'm not sure who thought of that or who even thinked it was a good idea to make, But the pass doesn't even work.
10. Previously and still even recently, Golden allows their brother (Torres) to ping everyone, Specifically to say a racial slur.
11. Golden purposely removed credits of some of their videos because of how petty they are and the small drama some script creators go through them
12. Golden purposefully steals the original code and puts it on their own loadstring, Possibly to add their own script such as IP logging, Data collection, Etc..

"see what I like is the idea of there being a website full of scripts that are public for everyone and people can even make money off of it, but how would the people get there money and HOW would be money be made, I believe That goldenhead is trying to take all of the money he can from good scripts that he doesn’t even make, the fucker doesn’t even know how to code witch is quite disrespectful to a community of people who spend there time coding and making a great script for someone big just to take all of the credit of the script and get CLOUT FOR IT"
What I find really disappointing is how the person who makes scripts for golden (tp exploit) barely gets recognition for the fact he made it and not golden head..
13. Golden, Specifically for this servers script, Has always renamed them.
Goes like this.
Original name - Golden head modified name.

Apophenia - Reaper
Arcaura - Jester
Volta - Voltar/Voltra
Vexor - Nyan Cat
14. Golden hiring actual children to moderate for their server (This resulted in them being nuked 3+ time's, Who would had thought?)
15. Calls the scripts undetected/unbannable, Knowing that they aren't. This isn't really that bad though.
16. In their YouTube, Golden has a great choice of words, Neither declining they made the script or approving it, They say that they'll make the script suggestions in the comment, But they don't, Why?
17. Golden can't code, He can't do anything but make showcases.
18. His entire channel/career depends on taking scripts that aren't theirs, But he has the audacity to not only not credit but at times outright take the credits
20. If the details were true; In which they aren't regarding the recent / 4 months ago controversy about hamlet doxxing, Golden publicly, Without censoring showcased their IP, And so much more information about them.
21. They let a 12 years old stay in the server, They only got hit with a temporary mute because of their actions, But then a moderator unmuted them.
